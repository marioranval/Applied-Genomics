# Applied-Genomics

Welcome to the "Applied-Genomics" repository!

Here, you will find a comprehensive collection of my assignments, projects, and homework from the Applied Genomics class I took during the enriching Spring of 2021. This repository serves as a testament to my journey through diverse topics within the realm of genomics.

Delve into the exciting world of Next-Generation Sequencing, where cutting-edge technologies unlock the secrets of genomes. Explore the intricacies of Sequence Alignment, honing your skills in aligning sequences and understanding their significance.

Dive into the realm of Variant Calling, where you'll learn to identify genetic variations that underpin phenotypic diversity. Uncover the mysteries of RNA-seq, dissecting gene expression patterns to gain insights into cellular functions.

Embark on the captivating journey of ChIP-seq, unraveling protein-DNA interactions and epigenetic landscapes. Immerse yourself in the revolutionary field of Single-Cell RNA-seq, discovering the hidden heterogeneity within cell populations.

Lastly, delve into Systems Biology, where we connect the dots and comprehend biological systems as a whole, understanding their complexity and behavior.

Join me in this repository as we venture through the realms of Applied Genomics and unlock the potential of genetic data to unravel the secrets of life.

Let's embark on this enriching genomics journey together!
